# About this Repo

This is a custom repo, to be used with Gitlab runner and Moodle. This includes configuration changes that are needed to be used with Moodle in a CI/CD environment, to avoid the need to set the configurations through CI/CD scripts. 
Readme files link to official repository, and should not be confused with this repo. They are left for informational purposes only.


This is a fork of the official Git repo of the Docker [official image](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/) for [mysql](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/). See [the Docker Hub page](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) for the full readme on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The full readme is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [docker-library/docs/mysql](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/mysql).

See a change merged here that doesn't show up on the Docker Hub yet? Check [the "library/mysql" manifest file in the docker-library/official-images repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/library/mysql), especially [PRs with the "library/mysql" label on that repo](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/labels/library%2Fmysql). For more information about the official images process, see the [docker-library/official-images readme](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images/blob/master/README.md).


This project is still verified through test, and uses docker cloud and travis CI to verify image status.
